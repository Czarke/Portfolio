                    <p>I'm a Computer Science graduate looking to transfer from IT Support into the software space. My interests lie in creating scalable apps in Javascript and Python. My goal is to find a position that allows me to actively learn and create meaningful products. When I'm not writing code I'm taking photos, lifting weights, studying Japanese, or playing video games.</p>
